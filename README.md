# GitHub Codespaces Practice

The purpose of this assignment is to practice using **GitHub Codespaces** to
work on your coding assignments in the absense of other viable options.

## Instructions

The assignment is to create a simple Python program that will print out the
following message to the console:

```
Hello, GitHub Codespaces!
```

The program should perform no other actions and should not take any input from
the user.

## Requirements

- All work **must** be done in the **GitHub Codespaces** environment. **Do
  not** clone the repository to your local machine.
- The program **must** written in a file named `hello.py`.
- The program **must** written in Python and should print the message to the
  console when executed (using the command `python3 hello.py`).
- The program **must** print the message exactly as shown above.
- The program **must** pass the provided tests (using the command `pytest`).
- The program **must not** take any input from the user.
- The program **must not** `return` the message as a value.

## Notes

- Remember to **commit and push** (AKA: **sync**) your changes to the repository
  when you are done.
- If you have any questions or need clarification, please **ask**. I'm here to
  help you succeed!
- Once you have completed the assignment, feel free to take out your
  district-issued Chromebook and give **GitHub Codespaces** a try on that
  device.
